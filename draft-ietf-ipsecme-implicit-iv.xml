        <abstract>

<t>Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) sends an initialization vector
(IV) in each packet. The size of IV depends on the applied transform,
being usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined by the time this
document is written. Some algorithms such as AES-GCM, AES-CCM and
ChaCha20-Poly1305 when used with IPsec, take the IV to generate a nonce
that is used as an input parameter for encrypting and decrypting. These
algorithms require a unique IV but do not require an unpredictable IV.
As a result, the value provided in the ESP Sequence Number (SN) can be
used instead to generate the nonce. This avoids sending the IV itself,
and saves in the case of AES-GCM, AES-CCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 8 octets
per packet. This document describes how to do this.</t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

<t>Counter-based AES modes of operation such as AES-CCM (<xref
target="RFC4309"/>), and AES-GCM (<xref target="RFC4106"/>) require the
specification of an nonce for each ESP packet. The same applies for
ChaCha20-Poly1305 (<xref target="RFC7634"/>). Currently this nonce is
generated thanks to the Initialize Vector (IV) provided in each ESP
packet (<xref target="RFC4303"/>). This practice is designated in this
document as "explicit nonce".</t>

<t>In some contexts, such as IoT, it may be preferable to avoid carrying
the extra bytes associated to the IV and instead generate it locally on
each peer. The local generation of the IV is designated in this
document as "implicit IV".</t>

<t>The size of this IV depends on the specific algorithm, but all of
the algorithms mentioned above take an 8-octet IV.</t>   

<t>This document defines how to compute the IV locally when it is
implicit. It also specifies how peers agree with the Internet Key
Exchange version 2 (IKEv2 - <xref target="RFC7296"/>) on using an
implicit IV versus an explicit IV.</t>

<t>This document limits its scope to the algorithms mentioned above.
Other algorithms with similar properties may later be defined to use
similar mechanism.</t> 

<t> This document does not consider AES-CBC (<xref target="RFC3602"/>)
as AES-CBC requires the IV to be unpredictable. Deriving it directly
from the packet counter as described below is insecure as mentioned in
Security Consideration of <xref target="RFC3602"/> and has led to real
world chosen plain-text attack such as BEAST <xref target="BEAST"/>.</t>

<t>This document does not consider AES-CTR <xref target="RFC3686"/> as
it focuses on the recommended AEAD suites provided in <xref
target="RFC8221"/>.</t>

<!--
<t>Section
3.5 of <xref target="RFC6407"/> provides a mechanism that MAY be used to
prevent IV collisions when the same key is used by multiple users. The
mechanism consists in partitioning the IV space between users by
assigning the most significant byte to a user. When implicit IV
transforms are used, such mechanism cannot be applied as the IV is not
sent, but instead it is derived from the Sequence Number. A similar
mechanism could be used by associating the most significant byte of the
Sequence Number to a sender, while the 3 remaining bytes will be used to
carry the counter value. Such mechanism prevents the use of Extended
Sequence Number and limits the number of packet to be sent to 2** 24 =
16777216, that is 16 M. Note that associating instead the least
significant byte of the Sequence Number to the sender, would enable the
system to use Extended Sequence Number and as such extend the limit of
packet to be sent to 2 ** ( 24 + 32 ) = 72057594037927936, that is 72 P.
Note also that in both cases the Sequence Number are not interpreted as
numeric values which impacts the replay window processing defined in
<xref target="RFC4302"/> and <xref target="RFC4302"/>.</t>

<t>Unless some mechanism are provided to avoid collision between
Sequence Number, ( and so IV ), Implicit IV MUST NOT be used. As such,
it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use Implicit IV with Multicast.</t>

    <section anchor="nego" title="Implicit IV Agreement">

<t>NOTE: THIS SECTION SHOWS SEVERAL WAYS TO DO THE SAME THING. OBVIOUSLY
THIS DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE PUBLISHED LIKE THAT. WE EXPECT WG DISCUSSION
TO PARE THIS DOWN TO JUST ONE WAY OF NEGOTIATING THE USE OF IMPLICIT IV
(IIV).</t>

<t>Negotiation of the use of implicit IV can be done in 3 different
ways: <list style="symbols">
        
<t> An IMPLICIT IV Transform Type. A proposal that contains this
transform type requires (if accepted) that IPsec use the implicit IV and
not include an explicit IV in the packets. To facilitate backward
compatibility with non-supporting implementations the Initiator SHOULD
add another proposal that does not include this transform type as well
as cryptographic suite the Initiator does not support the implicit
IV.</t>
        
<t> An IMPLICIT IV Transform ID. This doubles the number of ENCR
transform IDs by creating an ENCR_AES_CCM_16_IIV for each
ENCR_AES_CCM_16.</t>
          
<t> An IMPLICIT IV Transform Attribute, which would be associated to a
Transform Type ID, specifying the use of an implicit IV. marks a
particular ENCR transform as using implicit IVs. To facilitate backward
compatibility with non-supporting implementations the Initiator SHOULD
add another ENCR transform for each algorithm so marked. In other words,
for each ENCR_AES_CCM_16 with keylength=256 and IIV=1, there will need
to be an ENCR_AES_CCM_16 with keylength=256 and no IIV attribute.</t>
   
</list> </t>

    </section>
-->

    <section title="IKEv2 Initiator Behavior">

<t>An initiator supporting this feature SHOULD propose implicit IV
algorithms in the Transform Type 1 (Encryption Algorithm) Substructure
of the Proposal Substructure inside the SA Payload in the IKEv2
Exchange. To facilitate backward compatibility with non-supporting peers
the initiator SHOULD also include those same algorithms without Implicit
IV (IIV) as separate transforms.</t>

    
</section>
    
<section title="IKEv2 Responder Behavior">
      
<t>The rules of SA Payload processing require that responder picks its
algorithms from the proposal sent by the initiator, thus this will
ensure that the responder will never send an SA payload containing the
IIV transform to an initiator that did not propose it.</t>

</section> <section title="Security Considerations"> 

<t>Nonce generation for these algorithms has not been explicitly
defined. It has been left to the implementation as long as certain
security requirements are met. Typically, for AES-GCM, AES-CCM
and ChaCha20-Poly1305, the IV is not allowed to be repeated for one
particular key. This document provides an explicit and normative way to
generate IVs. The mechanism described in this document meets the IV
security requirements of all relevant algorithms.</t>  

<t> As the IV must not repeat for one SA when Counter-Mode ciphers are
used, Implicit IV as described in this document MUST NOT be used in
setups with the chance that the Sequence Number overlaps for one SA.
The sender's counter and the receiver's counter MUST be reset (by
establishing a new SA and thus a new key) prior to the transmission of
the 2^32nd packet for an SA that uses a non extended Sequence Number
(respectively the 2^64nd packet for an SA that uses an Extended Sequence
Number). This prevents sequence number overlaps for the mundane
point-to-point case. Multicast as described in <xref
target="RFC5374"/>, <xref target="RFC6407"/> and <xref
target="I-D.yeung-g-ikev2"/> is a prominent example, where many senders
share one secret and thus one SA.  As such, Implicit IV may only be used
with Multicast if some mechanisms are employed that prevent Sequence
Number to overlap for one SA, otherwise Implicit IV MUST NOT be used
with Multicast.  </t>

<t>This document defines three new encryption transforms that use
implicit IV. Unlike most encryption transforms defined to date, which
can be used for both ESP and IKEv2, these transforms are defined for ESP
only and cannot be used in IKEv2. The reason is that IKEv2 messages
don't contain a unique per-message value that can be used for IV
generation. The Message-ID field in IKEv2 header is similar to the SN
field in ESP header, but recent IKEv2 extensions (<xref
target="RFC6311"/>, <xref target="RFC7383"/>) do allow it to repeat, so
there is no an easy way to derive unique IV from IKEv2 header
fields.</t>
